# Getting Started with SQL

## Motivation 
This page is a curated list of resources to help our kids from the [Tri-Valley CoderDojo](https://trivalleycoderdojo.wordpress.com/) to get started with the Structured Query Language (SQL). 

## Getting Started

### Session 1
If this is your first exposure to SQL, you might want to check out the following introductory videos:
* [What is SQL? [in 4 minutes for beginners]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27axs9dO7AE&ab_channel=DanielleTh%C3%A9)
* [Learn Basic SQL in 10 mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEtnYWuo2Bw&ab_channel=JamesVance)

The following material might also help to understand the key concepts:
* [The Data School - Introduction](https://dataschool.com/how-to-teach-people-sql/introduction/)
* [The Data School - Why Databases](https://dataschool.com/how-to-teach-people-sql/why-databases/)
* [The Data School - Accessing Data](https://dataschool.com/how-to-teach-people-sql/accessing-data/)

Once you are familiar with the following concepts:

* Database, Table, Row, Column
* Basic query syntax (`select` statements)

Please feel free to try some of these exercises:

* [Select basics](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_basics)
* [Select names](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_names)

### Session 2
At this point you have done some basic queries, and are ready to try the next set of exercises:

* [Select from world](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_from_WORLD_Tutorial)
* [Select from Nobel](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_from_Nobel_Tutorial)

## Keep on learning and practicing
At this point you have the basics down, and you might want to consider other resources as well and continue learning about SQL.

### Start practicing SQL (using your Browser).
* [Sql Zoon - SQL_Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial)
* [SQLite Tutorial](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/)
* [CodeCademy - Learn SLQ](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)
* [replit](https://replit.com/)

You can you the replit website in two ways:

* To write python programs which use SQL to interact with a SQLite database in your browser.
* To directly write SQL to interact with a SQLite database in your browser.

### Use SQL with a local Database.
* [Install SQLite](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/)
* [Install a Database Viewer](https://dbeaver.io/download/) (useful if you want to interact with a database without writing Python Code)

### Use python to interact with a local Database

Check the python prerequisites. Then proceed to:

* Install [PySQLite](https://pypi.org/project/pysqlite/)

```pip install pysqlite```

* Go through the [SQLite Python tutorial](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-python/)

# Appendix

## Python Prerequisites
* Install [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (if needed)
